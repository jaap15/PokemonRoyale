Created in Corona SDK. This game is going to be a Pokémon Arena. When a new game is initiated from

the menu, the players will be able to select 1 of 3 random Pokémon, once he

selects his Pokémons, he will be able to select another Pokémon from another set

of 3 random Pokémons. This continues until the user has six Pokémon. Once he

has his deck of Pokémons, he will battle against enemy trainers and see how many

he can beat. The project is going to focus on core mechanics first, then focus on

adding variety to the game, such as multiple trainers, lots of Pokémon with unique

stats and hit points, etc.
